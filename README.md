# **OOPS**

# Overview:

[What is Object-Oriented Programming?](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)

Object-Oriented Programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

[How Object-Oriented Programming is related to real world?](https://fdhgjhjhukj.medium.com/object-oriented-programming-with-real-world-example-63f69f917d62)

Why we are write coding ,to solve our real world problem right. Real world can easily be demonstrated by OOPs concepts & principals.

[Why we need OOPs in Programming language?](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/forums/why-we-need-oops-in-programming-language)

1. Duplicate code is a Bad.
2. Code will always be changed.
3. Features of OOPs

# About Classes:

[What is a class?](https://www.guru99.com/java-oops-class-objects.html)

Class are a blueprint or a set of instructions to build a specific type of object.

[Access Modifiers in Java Classes](https://whimsical.com/object-oriented-programming-cheatsheet-by-love-babbar-YbSgLatbWQ4R5paV7EgqFw) [IMP]

Access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. There are four types of Java access modifiers: Private, Default, Public, Protected.

[Java Class Methods?](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_class_methods.asp)

[What are Java Constructors?](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-constructor)

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialise objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes. Read more about Default constructor, Parameterized constructor, Constructor Overloading

# About Objects:

[What is an Object?](https://www.guru99.com/java-oops-class-objects.html)

Object is an instance of a class. An object in OOPS is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful.

# About Keywords:

[Java static keyword](https://www.javatpoint.com/static-keyword-in-java)

The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class. Read more about static variable & static methods

[Java abstract Keyword](https://www.javatpoint.com/abstract-keyword-in-java) [IMP]

The abstract keyword is used to achieve abstraction in Java. It is a non-access modifier which is used to create abstract class and method.

The role of an abstract class is to contain abstract methods. However, it may also contain non-abstract methods. The method which is declared with abstract keyword and doesn't have any implementation is known as an abstract method.

[Java Final Keyword](https://www.javatpoint.com/final-keyword)

The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be: variable, method, class

[Java This Keyword](https://www.javatpoint.com/this-keyword)

In java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

[Java new Keyword](https://www.javatpoint.com/new-keyword-in-java)

The Java new keyword is used to create an instance of the class. In other words, it instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory. We can also use the new keyword to create the array object.

[Java Super Keyword](https://www.javatpoint.com/super-keyword)

The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

# Feature of OOPs: Inheritance

[What is Inheritance?](https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-java)

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object. Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship. Term to understand : Sub Class, Super Class, Reusability.

[What is the need of Inheritance?](https://www.youth4work.com/Talent/Core-Java/Forum/121637-what-is-the-need-of-inheritance)

[Type of Inheritance in Java](https://www.studytonight.com/java/inheritance-in-java.php)

Read : Disadvantage of Interface, Single Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance and Heirarchical Inheritance. Why Multiple inheritance is not supported in java?

[What are limitations of using Inheritance?](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/what-are-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-inheritance)

One main limitation is two classes (parent and child class) gets tightly coupled.

[Inheritance (IS-A relationship)](https://www.studytonight.com/java/inheritance-in-java.php) and [Aggregation (HAS-A relationship)](https://www.studytonight.com/java/aggregation.php) in Java

# Feature of OOPs: Polymorphism

[What is Polymorphism?](https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java)

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding. Read more about: Upcasting

# Feature of OOPs: Abstraction

[What is Abstraction?](https://www.javatpoint.com/abstract-class-in-java)

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

[Why use Abstraction?(In terms of real life)](https://www.sitesbay.com/java/java-abstraction)

There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

1. [Abstract class (0 to 100%)](https://www.javatpoint.com/abstract-class-in-java) : A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
2.  [Interface (100%)](https://www.javatpoint.com/interface-in-java)

[Encapsulation vs Abstraction real world example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12072980/encapsulation-vs-abstraction-real-world-example)

# Feature of OOPs: Encapsulation

[What is Encapsulation?](https://www.guru99.com/java-oops-encapsulation.html)

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism to wrap up variables(data) and methods(code) together as a single unit. It is the process of hiding information details and protecting data and behavior of the object.
